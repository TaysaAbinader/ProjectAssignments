# Task 1

Simulation can be used to mimic many of everyday situations, and help us, for example, improve  a service offered by the city, like Health Services.

Taking a Health Center service as an example, using simulation to mimic cenarios help plan in advance for many different real-life situations, which might reduce costs in hire extra staff that might be needed if a real-life simulation was to be done.

Use computer simulation can also reduce time, so there are no need to wait for some real-life cenarios to appear to analyse what could be done in response in determined situations, like a pandemic.

As a sustainability aspect, cloud computing might be used on running computer simulations, reducing the energy comsuption thyat might happen while processing data on real servers.
