# Task 4

Distributions are patterns of randomnss that help with predictions studies in probabilities.

There are many different types of predictions, among them some can be highlighted:

* Normal distribution: it's a symmetric bell-shaped distribution, also known as Gaussian distribution, where most values are around the average, and extremes are a rarity. Example: people's heights in a specific place or test scores on an exam;
* Uniform distribution: everything on a specific range is equally likely to occur. Example: the roll of a dice;
* Triangular distribution: it has a low and a high point, the peak being the most common value. As the name suggests it's shaped like a triangle. Example: estimate of travel time;
* Poisson distribution: it shows how often something can happen in a fixed sapce/time. Example: number of calls on a call center per unit of time;
* Log-normal distribution: it shows only positive and skewed numbers, showing many small values, and a few really high ones. Example: stock prices.
