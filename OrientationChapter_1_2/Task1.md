# Task 1

## Why does an arrival event need to generate a new arrival event?

Basically to simulate the real influx of what the system is aiming to simulate. When an arrival event occurs the system state is updated (new customer enters), but as the process is ongoing, it's necessary to already make the next arrival scheduled.



## Which event should be generated by the start of service (at a single service point)?

Considering the influx of the system, a service that starts should end in some moment. So logically a start of service should schedule an end of service event.
